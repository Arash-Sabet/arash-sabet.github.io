A veteran of the software industry and highly experienced in providing robust and cutting-edge technology solutions. My extensive experiences in product conception, design and implementation have led to many successful cloud-based, highly-efficient, and scalable enterprise solutions.

I am an entrepreneur with a strong vision for the unlimited potential of cutting-edge technologies and keen on finding creative solutions for the problems of todayâ€™s constantly changing business landscape. As the co-founder of my startup company, Proximitia Inc., I designed, implemented and rolled out an enterprise platform to create an infrastructure of Bluetooth access points to help marketers launch and manage proximity marketing campaigns by targeting mobile devices. 

I also initiated and led the implementation of several R&D projects at Umplify Inc. such as creating a solution to guarantee data consistency across a distributed environment where distributed database transactions cannot be applied. I have also started and led an Artificial Intelligence project as a solution to the problem of the tedious and labor-intensive task of shortlisting and screening job candidates. This solution serves the Human Resource industry by employing and augmenting machine learning algorithms, text analysis, NLP and sentiment extraction. These projects were awarded funding and received SR&ED tax credits from the Canadian Government.

The primary business objective at Umplify Inc. has been providing clients enterprise-scale custom software solutions. I have engaged and led many Fintech solutions in the Canadian finance sector by acquiring clients or partnership with other businesses. We have designed, implemented and deployed cloud solutions like point of sale ancillary revenue technology used by airlines, insurance rating systems, DuckCreek integration, actuary systems, accounting software, etc. by employing cutting-edge Microsoft cloud technologies and contemporary software architecture.
